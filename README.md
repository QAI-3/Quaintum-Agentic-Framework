# Quaintum Agentic Framework (Quantum AI)

This framework combines quantum computing, AI, and Web3 technologies to build intelligent agents capable of complex decision-making in a decentralized world.

## Features
- **Quantum Computing**: Support for quantum circuits, gates, and simulation.
- **Hybrid AI Models**: Mix quantum and classical AI models for advanced decision-making.
- **Web3 Integration**: Interaction with blockchain networks, DAO creation and much more.
- **Extensibility**: A modular system for adding new agents, models, and Web3 interactions.
